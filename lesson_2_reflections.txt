What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts to keep a log of it and its functions can be used for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
For files in staging area, git keeps a log and they can be committed, which is not the case for all files in the working directory, unless they are introduced to the staging area using git add. This allows selection of only the files needed for version control.
